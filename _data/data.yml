    summary: |
      Rediscovered my passion for coding and am excited to apply my experience
      and skills as a software developer once again. As a developer, I always seek 
      to understand the problem and collaborate on the solution.
      
      With over 25 years experience delivering software projects and apps,
      I have been a tester, business analyst, developer, project manager,
      product owner, consultant and director. I have also managed 
      staff and led teams in all these roles.
